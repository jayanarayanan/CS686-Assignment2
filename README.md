# Assignment 2 - CS686

**Author:** Jayanarayanan (Student ID: 20715015)

## Introduction

For Assignment 2 in the CS686 course, I have developed a straightforward Node.js application that effectively processes user input from a web form and then writes this information to a text file. While the task at hand was relatively uncomplicated, it provided valuable hands-on experience with the fundamentals of Node.js and web development.

## Implementation Details

### Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure that the following Node.js packages are installed:

-   **express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
-   **body-parser**: Middleware to extract the entire body portion of an incoming request stream.
-   **fs**: The built-in 'fs' module for working with the file system.

If any of these packages are not installed, you can easily add them via npm (Node Package Manager) using the following command:

```bash
npm i <package name>
```

### Running the Program

To execute this Node.js application, please follow these simple steps:

1. **Start the Node.js Server**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the Node.js server by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    node App.js
    ```

2. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and enter the following URL in the address bar:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```
